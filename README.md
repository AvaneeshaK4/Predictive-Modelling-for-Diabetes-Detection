# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Abstract
The disease “Diabetes Mellitus” is one of the most common critical diseases in the world. Early and accurate diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, especially during its initial development, is challenging for medical professionals. Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, providing a reference, can help them gain preliminary knowledge about this disease and reduce their workload accordingly. This study evaluates the performance of four machine learning models—Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree, in predicting diabetes based on a dataset containing relevant health parameters. The models were assessed using accuracy as the primary performance metric. The results demonstrated that the Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy at 95%, followed closely by KNN with 94.33%. Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models showed lower accuracies of 75.67% and 74.67%, respectively. The superior performance of the Random Forest and KNN models highlights their ability to capture complex patterns in the data, whereas Logistic Regression and Decision Tree offer benefits in interpretability and computational efficiency. These findings suggest that ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest, are highly effective for diabetes prediction, providing a robust tool for healthcare professionals. Future work should focus on enhancing model generalizability and exploring advanced machine learning techniques to further improve prediction accuracy and clinical applicability.
